- Mm-hm.

876

These are our suspects.

877
00:46:56,844 --> 00:46:59,045
A species called Dyadnum.

878
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:03,117
From a binary star system
in the constellation Draco.

879
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:04,950
Draco, that's
Hive territory.

880
00:47:04,952 --> 00:47:06,389

fell years ago.

The Dyads' DNA...

882

- are riddled with Hive mutations.
- AGENT H: Mm-hm.

883
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:16,128
AGENT HIGH T: As we all know, the Hive
doesn't just destroy their enemies,

884
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,231
they subsume them.

885
00:47:18,233 --> 00:47:19,999
Take them over from within.

886
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:22,503
Whoever these two were,
they're part of the Hive now.

887
00:47:22,505 --> 00:47:25,072
Yes, but why would the Hive
send them all this way

888
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:26,539
to kill a Jababian royal?

889
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,508
You knew Vungus
better than anyone.

890
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,276
Did he indicate
why he was here?

891
00:47:30,278 --> 00:47:31,878
Did he want something
from us?

892
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,615
No, he seemed
pretty normal, happy.

893

Sir. This whole thing
is a fiasco. It's a farrago.

And a failure
of this magnitude

895
00:47:38,353 --> 00:47:41,023

898
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,994
Uh, what is Article 13?

899
00:47:47,996 --> 00:47:51,600
Immediate termination,
followed by neuralyzation.

- Wait a second.
- AGENT HIGH T: Wait.

901
00:47:53,367 --> 00:47:54,534
- No.
- Is that your answer

902
00:47:54,536 --> 00:47:56,436
- to everything?
- AGENT H: Put that away!

how many people really knew
that he was here?

916
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,237
The people in this room.

917
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:33,539
And perhaps a dozen
high-level agents.

918
00:48:33,541 --> 00:48:37,043
If those were the only people
that knew where Vungus would be,

919
00:48:37,045 --> 00:48:38,681

that Vungus didn't leak

920
00:48:38,914 --> 00:48:40,380
his own location
to the killers,

921
00:48:40,382 --> 00:48:43,083
doesn't that mean
that it was someone...

922
00:48:43,085 --> 00:48:44,517
inside MIB?

923
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:47,086
A mole, sir,
inside these very walls.

924
00:48:47,088 --> 00:48:49,322
Sir, they're making this up
as they go along.

00:48:49,324 --> 00:48:51,557
"A mole"? In the history
of the company,

926
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:54,494
- there's never been a leak.
- Something a mole would say.

927
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,295
- Don't be absurd.
- Classic mole talk.

928
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,496
